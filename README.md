# HackIndia-The-Boyzz-CampusMate
CampusMate is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to simplify college life for students. It helps students stay on top of important deadlines, discover food nearby, manage college forms like hackathon registrations and leave applications, and handle other daily student tasks. Additionally, it offers a reminder feature to help students take timely breaks, such as a ‘chai break’, ensuring they stay refreshed during their busy schedules.

The idea behind CampusMate came from observing how students juggle a variety of responsibilities, including assignments, events, and administrative tasks. Our goal is to create a tool that acts as a helpful companion, always there to support students in managing their workload and personal tasks with ease and efficiency.

Some of the key features of CampusMate include:

Answering frequently asked questions.
Setting reminders for important deadlines and personal tasks.
Detecting “chai breaks” to remind students to take a quick pause during their hectic days.
Supporting everyday student needs through natural, conversational AI.
This project is being developed by a dedicated team consisting of:

Akshat Choudhary (Team Lead)
Anubhav Arora
Angad Kamra
Keshav Gupta
We are excited to bring this idea to life with the support of our mentors and peers. Our goal is to make campus life more manageable, productive, and enjoyable.

To build CampusMate, we are using the following technologies:

Django: For backend development, serving the AI-powered assistant, and managing the database.
HTML: For creating the structure and layout of the website.
CSS: For styling and designing an attractive user interface.
JavaScript: For enabling dynamic interactions and improving user experience.
With CampusMate, students will have a comprehensive tool at their fingertips, designed to assist them in managing both academic and personal aspects of their college life.
